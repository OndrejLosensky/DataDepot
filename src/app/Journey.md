On the day 9.3. in year 2024 I created this project 

# Daily activity
I try to add new notes each day that I work on this project, but I forgot a lot.

### Day 16.4. 2024
I have created an first base look for the Passwords Management Tool. I have also created an **ProgressBarRadial** that is for closed Sidebar to also show an usage of the storage. Also I tried to add some details to settings component. Yesterday I also added profile pictures to select from in the future. + Quick feature to toggle the sidebar by clicking `CMD` + `H` - to hide or show

Today I have found out about Pocketbase which I like and most likely will implement as main backend. Then I slightly changed the image thats on Hero section on the Landing page. I have changed Error and Success alerts UI and added function to detect if the password is the same and if it has minimaly 8 characters. 

Finally today I have added an function to log out when user is AFK. I have implemented it to the **RequireAuth** that renders the Dashboard. Today I did a lot of changes and work done. Including preparations for UsersPage for admin only.

Spent hours today: `5 hours &Â 30 min`
