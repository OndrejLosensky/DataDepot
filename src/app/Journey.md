## Day 16.4. 2024
I have created an first base look for the Passwords Management Tool. I have also created an **ProgressBarRadial** that is for closed Sidebar to also show an usage of the storage. Also I tried to add some details to settings component. Yesterday I also added profile pictures to select from in the future. + Quick feature to toggle the sidebar by clicking `CMD` + `H` - to hide or show

Today I have found out about Pocketbase which I like and most likely will implement as main backend. Then I slightly changed the image thats on Hero section on the Landing page. I have changed Error and Success alerts UI and added function to detect if the password is the same and if it has minimaly 8 characters. 

Finally today I have added an function to log out when user is AFK. I have implemented it to the **RequireAuth** that renders the Dashboard. Today I did a lot of changes and work done. Including preparations for UsersPage for admin only.

Spent hours today: `5 Hours & 30 min`

## Day 17.4 2024
On this day I havent done pretty much anything. Primary I added new section called the **Lab** where i can now test components, For users it wont be avaiable. Also I have an Users section that will be only for Admin. 

I updated `Password manager` to have an button that will be generating passwords. Then I have copied the same layout to the `Files` and created an demo look of how the each cart/folder could look like. Now I an few days I would like to implement and beter graphs as a testing in the Lab and Finish the Analytics and Users page UI 's so I can finally start making it work

## Day 18.4. 2024 
Today I a have imported some of my code into the Lab components where it will be my kinda "playground". Then I did some minor changes in the UI. Changed color of all cards to the same that look better on the contrast of the BG. Then I have finally started creating a functional `Password Manager`. I created an sqlite3 db with folders and passwords tables. Now the component can create an folder and save it in the db and then i can load them. 

Then i created an **Generate Password** component and added a button to the manager that opens it. The opening and changing those two components is simply handled using useState.

Also the Overview component was merged into the Analytics.

Spent hours today: `3 Hours `

## Day 19.4. 2024

Today I created an BTC graph using **Chart.js** So i could learn about using it for the analytics. The btc graph is inside the Lab. Then I added new button that will be for switch files or passwords layout. And the main thing I did was creating new more simple UI for the LoginPage that I will finish soon. 

Also I found some inspiration how to adjust the whole UI inside the dashboard. More updates coming soon. This is **4th day** in a row that I added to this file.

Spent hours today: `1 Hour 57 min`

Today I finally tried creating basic logic behind the folder system for passwords. Also It can fetch the date with number of added password (This function will be used inside the Analytics page)

Also I created the functionality to open help page which is just blank now. 

P.S. Today I did not have mood to work as I was really exhausted from last week.
